## PGL: A portable graph library

PGL provides a set of C++ objects and Python scripts to analyze, manipulate and simulate the structure of graphs (or [complex networks]).

Except for a few exceptions, every objects provided by the PGL are written in standard C++. They are provided via self-contained header files making them easily integrable into any C++ project (can be included similarly to any header-only libraries such as [Boost] or the [STL]).

<!--- Some functionalities of the C++ library are also available as a Python module. Objects in this module are simple wrappers around the C++ objects generated by [pybind11].--->

### Why another graph library?

The development of this library was motivated by the need of a __fast__, __lightweight__ and __customizable__ code, which was __easy to install__ and straightforward to deploy on __supercomputing facilities__ whose softwares are not always up-to-date.

At the beginning of this project, none of the existing high-quality libraries such as [graph-tool], [NetworkX] or [igraph] fulfilled the aforementionned requirements.

I therefore decided to start writing my own code, adding new features following the needs of my research. This is a work in progress; comments, suggestions, contributions and bug reports are welcome.

### Requirements

  * A C++11 (or newer) compliant compiler
  * Python 3.x
  <!--- * [pybind11] (for the Python module; should be installed automatically)--->


### Installation<!-- (Linux, OS X)-->

Clone this reporsitory using the `--recurse-submodules` option (see [Git documentation]), for example:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/antoineallard/a-portable-graph-library.git
```
and then
##### C++
  * copy the required header file (`<sub-module>/src/<class object>.hpp`) file in your project directory.
  * add `#include <class object>.hpp` to your C++ code

##### Python module
  * copy the required script file (`<sub-module>/src/<script file>.hpp`) file in your project directory.
  * add `import <script file>` to your Python script


### Available sub-modules

There is no extensive documentation. However we provide several tutorials in the form of C++ codes and Jupyter notebooks to illustrate how to use the PGL. Codes validating several functionalities of the PGL provide additional examples and are located in most sub-module's `validation/` sub-directory.

#### Structure of graphs

  * `directed_graph`: Provides functions to compute and extract various structural properties of simple unweighted directed graphs without self-loops.
<!--- Most of these functionalities are also available in the `pgl` Python module.--->


#### Random graph generators

  * `geometric_Sd_model`: Generates random geometric graphs according to the S^D model.

  * `l-cloning` Generates an undirected edgelist using the [L-cloning algorithm][6]. <!--As the number of copies goes to infinity, the generated edgelist belongs to the ensemble considered in the message passing approach.-->


#### Percolation on graphs

  * `percolation_on_graph`: Provides functions to efficiently simulate bond percolation on simple unweighted undirected graphs without self-loops.
